An Operating system (OS) is a software that acts as an interface between the end user and computer capabilities of hardware. Every computer must have one or more OS to run other programs. 
An application like
 Chrome, MS Word, Games, etc needs an environment in which it will run and perform its task. The OS will help you to communicate with the computer without
 knowing how to speak the computer's language. It is impossible for the user to use any computer or mobile device without having an operating system.
